A basic Perl script which takes all tcx files starting with the word
"activity" and merges them together.

The point of this script is to take the 89 runs I've done using my
Garmin Forerunner 405 and copy them to Endomondo.  I shall be
continuing to use my Garmin, but the Endomondo web site has better
social aspects to it, in some ways, so I figure I shall use both for
the time being.

Anyway, to use the script, all you do is export all the activities
from the Garmin Connect web site that you want to migrate, get them
all in the same directory, and then from within that directory, call
the merge_tcx_files script.  It will create a file called merged.tcx
which contains all of your activities in one file.

Note that Endomondo only accept tcx files up to 6MB, so if you have
activities totalling more than that, you'll need to merge them up in
blocks of no more than 6MB.
